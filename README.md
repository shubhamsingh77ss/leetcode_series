Daily LeetCode challenge solutions with clear explanations and optimized approaches. This repo tracks my problem-solving journey, strengthens DSA concepts, and serves as a resource for interview prep and consistent coding practice.
📝 LeetCode Daily Series – Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Series! 🌟
Every day, I’ll be solving at least one coding problem from LeetCode and sharing my approach, code, and thought process.

🎯 Goals:

Strengthen my DSA concepts (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.).

Build problem-solving consistency through daily practice.

Explore multiple approaches (brute force → optimized).

Track progress and improve speed for coding interviews.

📌 What to Expect:

Daily problem statement (from LeetCode).

Step-by-step explanation of logic.

Optimized C++/Python solutions with comments.

Edge cases and complexity analysis.

🔥 Why this series?

To build the habit of consistent coding.

To help others learn from my solutions.

To prepare effectively for FAANG-level interviews and other competitive exams.

Stay tuned for daily updates, and feel free to discuss your approaches too! 🚀
